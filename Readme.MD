First part of the test task:

The Smoke Test Report is located in the “manual_tests” folder of this repository. Examples of bug reports are also located there.

Second part of the test task:

The test framework is created using the following Python libraries: Selenium WebDriver, ChromeDriverManager, PyTest, Allure Report. It is located in the “auto_tests” folder of this repository. The test reporting system is implemented using Allure Reports, and the reports themselves are stored in the “/tests/reports” folder.

In case of further project development, the framework can be easily scaled using the Page Object Model design pattern. If API tests are added, the Requests library is planned to be used.
